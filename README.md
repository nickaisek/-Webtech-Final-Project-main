•	Validation:
	The project validates user input using Spring Validation.
•	Pagination:
	The project implement pagination for database queries using Spring Data JPA.
	The project splits large amounts of data into smaller chunks to improve performance.
•	Error Handling:
	The project handles errors and exceptions gracefully using Spring MVC's exception-handling mechanism.
	The project catches and handle exceptions and display appropriate error messages to the user.

•	Spring Security works, for example, when a user tries to access a protected part, Spring Security will check if the user is authenticated. If the user is not authenticated, Spring Security will redirect the user to the login page.
•	Once the user is authenticated, Spring Security will check if the user has the necessary permissions to access that part. If the user does not have the necessary permissions, Spring Security will deny the request.
